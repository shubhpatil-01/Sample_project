Important Data
A few common things people mean (tell me which one fits, or add your own):
Use Git with Python projects that process data
(best practices for versioning datasets, .gitignore, DVC, etc.)
Access data from GitHub using Python
(clone repos, download CSV/JSON files, use the GitHub API)
Control Git from Python code
(using gitpython, running git commands programmatically)
Data science workflow with Git
(branching, experiments, notebooks, reproducibility)
Something else entirely — quick description works

What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files over time.
It lets you:
Save versions of your work
Go back to earlier state
Collaborate without overwriting each other
Experiment safely using branches
Core Concepts (the stuff that matters)
Repository (repo)
A project tracked by Git.
git init
Commit
A snapshot of your files at a moment in time.
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful message"
Branch
A parallel line of development (for features, experiments, fixes).
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
# or
git switch -c new-feature
Remote
A copy of your repo stored elsewhere (like GitHub).
git remote add origin URL
git push -u origin main
Everyday Git Workflow
git status        # see what's changed
git add file.py   # stage changes
git commit -m "Describe what changed"
git pull          # get latest changes
git push          # s
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

config files, SSH keys, repos, cache, etc.
